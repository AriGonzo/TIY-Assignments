            <h1> Insane in the Mainframe </h1>

            <p> Why would I want to know that? Your best is an idiot!
              With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be
              fun! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud
              upthrust bosoms. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored
              with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust
              for violence? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
              Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? You're going to do his laundry? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

            <p> Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Who's brave enough to
              fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? For one
              beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother.
              Subjugated, yet honored.

              You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? These old Doomsday
              Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing
              where they are. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Oh no! The professor will
              hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' itâ€¦ then perhaps gifts! Now, now.
              Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Who's brave
              enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
              Hello Morbo, how's the family? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence
              never solved anything. With gusto. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill
              out to have her taken away!

            <h1> The Late Philip J. Fry </h1>

            <p> You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal
              parasites? You are the last hope of the universe. Guards! Bring me
              the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! THE BIG BRAIN
              AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO
              RAISEN! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on
              between two consenting adults.

              I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up!
              Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
              You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? I am Singing Wind,
              Chief of the Martians. Your best is an idiot!

              We're rescuing ya. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never
              solved anything. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with
              sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for
              violence? Fatal. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry
              of his humanity the way only a woman can.
