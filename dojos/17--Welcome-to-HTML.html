    <h3>BATMAN Ipsum</h3>
    <p>
      If you're good at something, never do it for free.

You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life.

You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

    Once upon a time, Brother Anancy and his good friend, Brother Lion were hungry and were in the mood for something tasty to eat. They decided that they wanted to have some chicken at Island Grill. Brother Anancy had just bought a sporty new car and offered to drive. But there was only one problem. Brother Anancy did not know how to get to Island Grill by car. Luckily, Brother Anancy's new car came equipped with a Jamaican GPS Navigation system. He was certain the GPS could get him to the restaurant.

    <h3>Sheen Ipsum</h3>
    <p>And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life
isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .... And I'm not
perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. Let me just
say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own
selfish exit strategy, bro. No. She's not there now. So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace.</p>
